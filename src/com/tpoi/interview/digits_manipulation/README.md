# Digit Manipulation

This one is from [here](http://blog.gainlo.co/index.php/2017/01/20/arrange-given-numbers-to-form-the-biggest-number-possible/).

## First case 

Write a function that takes a number as input and outputs the biggest number with the same set of digits.

```
For example, suppose the input is 423865, then the biggest number with these digits is 865432.
```

## Second case
Letâ€™s change the question a little bit. How can you get the next greater number with the same set of digits?

```
For example, suppose the input is 423862, then the biggest number with these digits is 426238.
```
